# DogBreedDeepLearning
World-class algorithm to identify various dog breeds, using Fast.ai library.
Employs resnet34 and resnet50 architectures (https://github.com/KaimingHe/deep-residual-networks).
Model is pre-trained in cycles to cancel out noise and braoden gradient descent.
Photo manipulation encoded to search for more deterministic traits in photos.
